## Initialize the framework.
libstdc++-dg-init

## Set ulimits.  This should normally be handled on test-by-test
## basis through @xxx@-keywords.
## The following limit is expressed in kilobytes.  For history, Have a 
## look at http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/libstdc++/2000-10/msg00029.html
set maximum-memory-usage 16384
set shell-ulimit-command ulimit
remote_exec host ${shell-ulimit-command} "-d ${maximum-memory-usage}"
remote_exec host ${shell-ulimit-command} "-v ${maximum-memory-usage}"

## Now, do the work directory by directory

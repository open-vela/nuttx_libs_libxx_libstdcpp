We're in the process of converting the existing testsuite machinery to
use the new style DejaGnu framework.  Eventually, we'll abandon
../mkcheck.in in favor of this new testsuite framework.  

  Basically, a testcase contains dg-keywords (see dg.exp) indicating
what to do and what kind of behaviour are to be expected.  New
testsuite should be written with the new style DejaGnu framework in mind.

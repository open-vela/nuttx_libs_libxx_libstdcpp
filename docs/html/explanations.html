<A NAME="cstdio"><H3>&quot;I/O packages&quot;, <TT>--enable-cstdio</TT></H3></A>
<P>In addition to all the nifty things which C++ can do for I/O, its library
   also includes all of the I/O capabilites of C.  Making them work together
   can be a challenge, not only
   <A HREF="27_io/howto.html#8">for the programmer</A> but for the
   implementors as well.
</P>
<P>There are two ways to do a C++ library:  the cool way, and the easy way.
   More specifically, the cool-but-easy-to-get-wrong way, and the
   easy-to-guarantee-correct-behavior way.  For 3.0, the easy way is used.
</P>
<P>Choosing 'stdio' is the easy way.  It builds a C++ library which forwards
   all operations to the C library.  Many of the C++ I/O functions are
   specified in the standard 'as if' they called a certain C function; the
   easiest way to get it correct is to actually call that function.  The
   disadvantage is that the C++ code will run slower (fortunately, the layer
   is thin).
</P>
<P>Choosing 'libio' is the cool way; it allows C++ and C to share some
   buffers.  It's disabled because of tricky synchronization issues.  Other
   cool ways (various methods of sharing resources between C and C++
   facilities, instead of layering) are possible.  This approach can speed
   up I/O significantly.
</P>
<P>Other packages are possible.  For a new package, a header must be
   written to provide types like streamsize (usually just a typedef), as
   well as some internal types like<TT> __c_file_type </TT> and
   <TT> __c_lock </TT> (for the stdio case, these are FILE (as in
   &quot;FILE*&quot;) and a simple POSIX mutex, respectively).  An
   interface class called <TT> __basic_file </TT> must also be filled in;
   as an example, for the stdio case, these member functions are all
   inline calles to fread, fwrite, etc.
